                    <li>Generate Passive Rewards: One of the main attractions of NFT staking is that it allows collectors or investors to earn passive income. By locking your NFTs in a staking platform, you can receive rewards in the form of native tokens, other exclusive NFTs, or even benefits within a game or metaverse. It's a way to earn extra profit without having to sell your assets.
